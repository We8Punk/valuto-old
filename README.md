Before you start mining VLU
-------

You are welcome to mine VLU, even when the diff is low and reward is high. But remember, that VLU is what it is, until we launch V-Market(working name). 

V-Market(working name) is going to be, the biggest crypto powered marketplace on the vanilla web. Think Amazon(In functionality, not size), but with the added bonus of using a crypto currrency and having 100% safe escrow. 

Compiling binary for *nix
-------
In Ubuntu you need the following dependencies:

``` 
sudo apt-get install build-essential libboost-all-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libdb5.3-dev libdb5.3++-dev git qt-sdk libminiupnpc-dev libssl-dev

``` 

Where is the GUI?
-------

The GUI for valutod is currently under development. It is being coded in python/kivy to be crossplatform and "nice" to the eye.


Marketplace - Huh?
-------

Not to forget... by using your Valutos in the marketplace, you are building the worlds first 100% community driven marketplace.
